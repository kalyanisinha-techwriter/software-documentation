        <h1>Topic  Docker Fundamentals: The "It Works on My Machine" Problem</h1>
        <p>## 1. The Problem: Environmental Inconsistency</p>
        <p>Before using Docker, developers often face issues where code runs perfectly in one environment but fails in another.</p>
        <p>**The Example Scenario:**</p>
        <p>*   **Local Development:** You are working on a Node.js application on your laptop. You have **Node version 14.4.0** installed. The app works perfectly.</p>
        <p>*   **Production Server:** The server where you deploy the app is running **Node version 16.16.0**.</p>
        <p>*   **The Result:** When you deploy, the application breaks.</p>
        <p>This happens because of **environment differences**. The dependencies, libraries, or runtime versions differ between the developer's machine and the server.</p>
        <p>## 2. The Solution: Containerization</p>
        <p>Docker solves this by allowing you to package the application along with its entire environment.</p>
        <p>**How Docker handles this:**</p>
        <p>*   It packages the **Application Code**.</p>
        <p>*   It includes the **Libraries and Dependencies**.</p>
        <p>*   It includes the specific **Configurations**.</p>
        <p>It wraps all of these into a single **Container**.</p>
        <p>## 3. The Result</p>
        <p>Because everything the application needs is inside the container, it becomes a standardized unit.</p>
        <p>*   **Portability:** You can move this container anywhere.</p>
        <p>*   **Consistency:** It will run exactly the same way on:</p>
        <p>*   Local Development</p>
        <p>*   Test Servers</p>
        <p>*   Production Environments</p>
        <p>**Key Takeaway:** Docker eliminates the "It works on my machine" problem by ensuring the environment travels with the code.</p>
